//
//  Strips credentials out of anything on its way to a diagnostics sink.
//
//  Plex authenticates with `X-Plex-Token` as a URL QUERY PARAMETER, not a
//  header, so any URL we log or attach to an error event carries a working
//  credential for that user's Plex account. IPTV/Xtream providers are worse:
//  their M3U and EPG URLs commonly carry `username`/`password` in the query.
//
//  Two things reach Sentry, and both need covering:
//    1. Values we attach ourselves (`scope.setExtra(url.absoluteString, ...)`).
//    2. Events the SDK builds itself — `enableCaptureFailedRequests` attaches
//       the failing request URL, and NSError descriptions embed the URL too.
//  Call sites can only fix (1), so the real guarantee is the `beforeSend` hook
//  in RivuletApp, which runs this over every outgoing event. Call sites are
//  still cleaned up so we don't ship secrets to a sink that merely scrubs them.
//
//  `nonisolated` to match SentryBridge: this runs on the error path from any
//  isolation context and must not cost an actor hop.

//  LiveTVAetherPlayerViewController.swift
//  Rivulet
//
//  Live TV player on Rivulet's own chrome (no AVKit). Video renders through
//  the engine surface (`AetherPlayerView` → `engine.bind(view:)`), which hosts
//  whichever layer the active backend uses — AVPlayerLayer on the native /
//  loopback-HLS paths, AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer on the software path
//  (MPEG-2, interlaced H.264). Audio is engine-owned: with no AVKit in the
//  picture the renderer activates the audio session itself, which is what the
//  multi-stream grid already relies on.
//
//  Chrome: the same UIKit glass rail as Aether VOD (PlayerRailView +
//  PlayerRailPanelView), driven by GUIDE data instead of Plex metadata —
//  programme title/times from LiveTVDataStore's EPG, subtitle and audio
//  pickers from the engine's track lists (CardTrackListView), and a
//  guide-fed info card (LiveGuideInfoCardView). Select shows the rail,
//  Menu hides it (or dismisses the player when it's already hidden).
//
//  Subtitles (including DVB/teletext decoded engine-side) render through
//  CaptionOverlayView, the same overlay Aether VOD uses.
//
//  Playback routing (inside `AetherPlayer.loadLive`):
//    - plain HLS (.m3u8 / format=hls) → nativeRemoteHLS: AVPlayer plays the
//      remote playlist directly, engine re-attaches its layer to the surface.
//    - raw MPEG-TS and Plex tuned sessions (progressive start.ts remux) →
//      engine demux/decode.
//
//  Failure ladder (each stage re-resolves the URL — fresh Plex tune/session):
//    0 primary → 1 engine demux → 2 bare AVPlayer on an AVPlayerLayer.

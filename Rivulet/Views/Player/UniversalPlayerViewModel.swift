    /// After an aether startup failure, fetch a small prefix of the stream URL
    /// and record WHAT the server actually returned.
    ///
    /// Why this exists
    /// ---------------
    /// RIVULET-19 is `HLSVideoEngine: open failed (openFailed(code:
    /// -1094995529))`, the project's largest unresolved error. That code is
    /// FFmpeg's AVERROR_INVALIDDATA, raised when the demuxer opened a byte
    /// stream and could not parse it as media. It fires on the aether route at
    /// startup across every codec, resolution and dynamic range we ship, which
    /// rules out a codec or container cause and points at the bytes simply not
    /// being the media file. The engine identifies containers purely by probing
    /// the first bytes, so any non-media body (an HTML error page, a JSON error,
    /// a login redirect) fails exactly this way. What we cannot tell from the
    /// current telemetry is WHICH non-media body dominates. One release of this
    /// classification answers that.
    ///
    /// Why there is no preflight on the success path
    /// ---------------------------------------------
    /// This runs ONLY from the aether failure catch. Nobody should later
    /// "improve" it into a check that runs before every direct play. A preflight
    /// on the hot path would add a network round trip to every single playback
    /// start to serve a case that, by the numbers, is rare and already
    /// self-rescuing: roughly 95 percent of these failures are silently
    /// recovered by the HLS fallback. That is the definition of a "just in case"
    /// feature the project's design philosophy rejects, and it would cost every
    /// user latency to diagnose a minority. Diagnostics belong on the path that
    /// is already broken.
    ///
    /// Why it does not block the fallback
    /// ----------------------------------
    /// The call site does not await this. The user is already staring at a
    /// stalled player, and the HLS fallback is their recovery, so inserting even
    /// a few seconds of probe in front of it would trade a real user-visible
    /// delay for a diagnostic. Running it concurrently costs the fallback
    /// nothing measurable: it is a single ranged GET of one kilobyte against a
    /// server the fallback is not using (the fallback targets the Plex transcode
    /// endpoint, this targets the direct-play origin that just failed).
    ///
    /// Why it cannot make a failure worse
    /// ----------------------------------
    /// Everything inside is best-effort. The request has its own short timeout,
    /// every error is swallowed, and no result of this function is ever read by
    /// playback logic. If it throws, hangs or returns nothing, the fallback
    /// proceeds exactly as it did before this existed.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - url: The direct-play URL the engine failed to open. Used ONLY to
    ///     build the request. It is never logged, never attached to an event,
    ///     and never included in any string this function produces.
    ///   - headers: The same headers the failed load used, so the probe sees
    ///     what the engine saw rather than an unauthenticated response.
    ///   - error: The originating aether failure, reported as the event's error
    ///     so the probe lands on the same issue lineage.
    ///   - kind: The classified failure, carried as a tag for filtering.
